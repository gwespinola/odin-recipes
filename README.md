# odin-recipes
First assignment for The Odin Project

The objective is to show what I've learned so far in the Foundations part of the TOP curriculum.

This project is thought as an introduction to webdevelopment and will consist of a main index page with a few links to some recipes.

The objective is to just build my HTML skills and no CSS will be used for now.

Later, I will revisit the project to style it with CSS.
